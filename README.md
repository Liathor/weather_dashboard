# Weather Forecast App

## Description
This app allows for a user to enter a city name, upon which they will be provided with the current weather conditions of that city, as well as the forecasted weather for the next 5 days. It will also remember the cities the user has looked up, allowing them to check the weather conditions there at the click of a button. They can also delete cities they do not want in their list.
